# US Minimum Wage vs. Student Expenses Visualization

## Project Overview
This D3.js project visualizes the relationship between minimum wage levels and student expenses across the United States over time. It features interactive maps and line charts to explore how changes in minimum wage may correlate with the expenses incurred by students, offering insights into the economic pressures faced by the student population.

## Features
- **Interactive US Map**: Displays minimum wage by state, color-coded for quick analysis. Users can click on a state to see detailed trends over time.
- **Time Slider**: Allows users to select a year and view the corresponding data on the map, showcasing changes in minimum wage over time.
- **Wage Buttons**: Users can toggle between different wage data views, including state minimum wage, state minimum wage adjusted to 2020 dollars, effective minimum wage, and effective minimum wage in 2020 dollars.
- **Line Chart Visualization**: Presents a detailed comparison of minimum wage versus student expenses when a state is selected, highlighting the trends over the selected period.
